# ts-node-starter
A minimal configuration for getting up and running in Typescript as quickly as possible

## Features
- Linting and formatting out of the box
- Write Jest tests in typescript with type-checking
- Smooth development experience with hot reload and no waiting for typescript compiles while running in dev mode
- Autobind class methods: Never write `this.classMethod = this.classMethod.bind(this)` again!
